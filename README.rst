**The Littlest JupyterHub** (TLJH) distribution helps you provide Jupyter Notebooks
to 1-50 users on a single server.

Administrators who do not consider themselves 'system administrators' but would
like to provide hosted Jupyter Notebooks for their students / users are the
primary audience. All users get the same environment, and administrators can
install libraries into this environment without any specialized knowledge.
